title: "Animation Compression: Table of Contents"
---
I am in the process of getting a presentation approved for the [GDC 2017](http://www.gdconf.com/) on the topic of character animation compression. While the topic is warm and fresh in my memory, I thought it would do me some good to take a break from [memory allocators]({% post_url 2016-10-18-memory_allocators_toc %}) and talk about the various approaches to this. I also happen to have some free time ahead of me before I find and start my next contract.

While I will not be able to cover the presentation content prior to the conference (if it is approved), I will cover as much material as I can while leading up to it and eventually it will make its way on here.

This post is meant as a table of content that will link to all the relevant topics I will cover. It will be updated as time goes by and as material is published.

I will do my best to keep this series of posts self contained and detailed enough to be approachable to a wide audience. The amount of material out there regarding animation compression is surprisingly very thin or often poorly detailed. My hope is for this series to serve as a reference for anyone curious about this topic and looking at improving or implementing these techniques.

If time permits, and if I can get approval from various relevant parties, I might go ahead and implement some of these techniques into an actual production ready library.
